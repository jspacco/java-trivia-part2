# Java Trivia

## ex1: returning -1 vs returning null

## ex2: using a Map to store stats is error prone; use a class instead

## ex4: TODO: Checked VS Unchecked Exceptions
* Don't print when something goes wrong, throw an exception instead
* return null vs throw an exception?


## Future Topics
* gradle and build management
* putting new projects onto Github
